# Project Idea

This is an app that automates file manipulation in FTP or local servers. The goal of the app is to minimize error due to the repetitive nature of the tasks. Sometimes, one simple mistake can cost a lot to the company so in order to avoid this risks, I'm planning on automating this part of the workflow since we do a lot of file manipulation daily as part of the job.

The app will be written in Python and will run in the command line (for now) with plans to create a GUI later on if the app succeeds.
