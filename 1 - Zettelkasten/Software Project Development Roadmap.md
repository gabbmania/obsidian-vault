# Software Project Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Planning and Setup (1-2 Weeks):

**Goal**: Lay the groundwork for the project.

**Tasks**:
1. Define Requirements:
    - Finalize the list of client-facing and service center-facing features.
    - Prioritize features for the MVP (Minimum Viable Product).
2. Set Up Development Environment:
    - Install Python, Django, ReactJS, and PostgreSQL.
    - Set up version control (Git) and create a GitHub repository.
3. Design Database Schema:
    - Define tables for users, appointments, service history, inventory, etc.
    - Create an ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) for reference.
4. Set Up Kanban Board:
    - Use Trello or Notion to create a Kanban board.
    - Break down the project into tasks and add them to the “To Do” column.

### Phase 2: Backend Development (4-6 Weeks)

**Goal**: Build the core backend functionality.

###### Sprint 1: User Authentication and Authorization (1-2 Weeks)
- Tasks:
    - Implement user registration and login (JWT or OAuth2).
    - Create user roles (e.g., Customer, Service Center Admin).
    - Write unit tests for authentication.

###### Sprint 2: Appointment Scheduling (2 Weeks)
- Tasks:
    - Create models for appointments (e.g., date, time, service type).
    - Build API endpoints for scheduling and viewing appointments.
    - Integrate with the frontend (basic UI for testing).

###### Sprint 3: Inventory Management (1-2 Weeks)
- Tasks:
    - Create models for inventory (e.g., parts, consumables, quantities).
    - Build API endpoints for adding, updating, and viewing inventory.
    - Implement low stock alerts.

### Phase 3: Frontend Development (4-6 Weeks)

**Goal**: Build the user interface and connect it to the backend.

###### Sprint 4: Client-Facing UI (2-3 Weeks)
- Tasks:
    - Design and implement the appointment scheduling UI (ReactJS + TailwindCSS).
    - Create a dashboard for customers to view service history.
    - Add real-time notifications (e.g., appointment status updates).

###### Sprint 5: Service Center-Facing UI (2-3 Weeks)
- Tasks:
    - Design and implement the inventory management UI.
    - Create a dashboard for service centers to track orders and inventory.
    - Add analytics charts (e.g., popular services, inventory trends).

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (4-6 Weeks)

**Goal**: Add advanced functionality to enhance the app.

###### Sprint 6: Payment Integration (2 Weeks)
- Tasks:
    - Integrate Stripe for payment processing.
    - Add a payment UI for customers.
    - Test payment flows (e.g., successful and failed transactions).

###### Sprint 7: Real-Time Updates (1-2 Weeks)
- Tasks:
    - Implement WebSockets or Firebase for real-time notifications.
    - Notify customers about appointment status (e.g., “Your car is ready”).
    - Notify service centers about low stock alerts.

###### Sprint 8: Multi-Language Support (1-2 Weeks)
- Tasks:
    - Add support for multiple languages (e.g., English, Spanish).
    - Use a library like `i18next` for frontend translations.
    - Test language switching functionality.

### Phase 5: Testing and Optimization (2-3 Weeks)

**Goal**: Ensure the app is bug-free and performs well.

Tasks:
1. Write Unit and Integration Tests
    - Test backend APIs (e.g., Django Rest Framework testing tools).
    - Test frontend components (e.g., Jest + React Testing Library).
2. Performance Optimization:
    - Optimize database queries (e.g., indexing, caching).
    - Test app performance under load (e.g., using Apache JMeter).
3. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**:
    - Test the app with real users (e.g., friends or family).
    - Gather feedback and fix bugs.

### Phase 6: Deployment and Launch (1-2 Weeks)

**Goal**: Deploy the app and make it available to users.

Tasks:
1. Set Up Cloud Hosting:
    - Deploy the backend on AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure.
    - Deploy the frontend on Netlify or Vercel.
2. Configure CI/CD Pipeline:
    - Set up automated testing and deployment (e.g., GitHub Actions).
3. Launch the App:
    - Create a landing page to promote the app.
    - Share the app with service centers and customers for feedback.

### Phase 7: Post-Launch (Ongoing)

**Goal**: Continuously improve the app based on user feedback.

Tasks:
1. Monitor Performance:
    - Use tools like Sentry or Datadog for error tracking.
    - Monitor server performance and uptime.
2. Add New Features:
    - Implement feedback and ratings for service centers.
    - Add GPS integration for finding nearby service centers.
3. Scale the App:
    - Optimize the app for more users and service centers.
    - Consider building a mobile app (React Native).
