# Reading and Taking Notes

Reading and taking notes helps improve in our intellectual learning. Writing something in your own words helps us improve our learning capability. Studies shows that writing or taking notes of the topic we have read contributes to an increase in our learning capacity or it helps us learn easier about the topic. This is because when we write or take notes about the topic, we have to think about it and explain it in our own words. We also do some internal dialogue about the topic we have read which in turn helps us learn.
