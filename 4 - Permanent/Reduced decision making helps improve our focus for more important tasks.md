# Reduced decision making helps improve our focus for more important tasks

Having to not decide more often can help us improve our focus. This is due to the fact that decision making takes willpower, which is a limited resource of humans. Since it is easily depleted by decision making, having a structure form of note taking helps reduce decision making since the structure is already there and we just need to follow it.

Taking breaks also help us recover and remember. The human brain has this ability that we need to take breaks in order for it to process the information it gathers. Whether the information we gained will be send to the long-term memory or short term memory.
