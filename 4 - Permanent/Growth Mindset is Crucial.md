# Growth Mindset is Crucial

We are taking notes in order to improve ourselves. Note taking contributes to intellectual learning and idea generation. In order for note taking to be effective or useful, we then need to have a growth mindset. A mindset that tells us that we need to further grow ourselves intellectually. Note taking without the growth mindset will be useless.
