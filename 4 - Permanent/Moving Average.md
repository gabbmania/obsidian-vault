# Moving Average

MA smooth out price fluctuations to better see trends in the prices. There are two types of MAs:
1. Simple - prone to price spikes and is slow to react to price movements.
2. Exponential - emphasize on most recent prices to smooth out price spikes and is quick to react to price movements.

Two or more MAs working together can show trends. Once two MAs crossover one another (faster MA crossover slower MA), it can signify a start or end of a trend.

Another way to use MAs for trading are as support and resistance level during a trend. Price can test the MA. Envelops can also be used along side MAs. Envelops are parallel lines with MAs that shows an upper and lower bound. This upper and lower bounds identify areas that are overbought or oversold which is a good indication for a trade entry.
