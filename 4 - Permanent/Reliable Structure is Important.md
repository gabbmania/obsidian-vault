# Reliable Structure is Important

Having a reliable note taking structure is important. It helps contribute to how effective the notes we have taken will be. Poor structure will lead to useless notes, just a bunch of useless paper. But having a reliable note taking structure will help improve our idea generation since the notes we take will be easier to reference to due to its structure.
