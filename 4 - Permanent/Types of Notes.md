# Types of Notes

There are three types of notes based on the book How to Take Smart Notes by Sonke Ahrens. These three are: fleeting notes; permanent notes; and project notes.

Each one of these notes differ by the following:
1. **Fleeting notes** are for sudden ideas that you need to write when you are busy doing something else. The purpose of this type of note is just to take note of your sudden ideas or of what your read or heard somewhere. This doesn't need to be complex, just simple words are enough. It can even be as short as a sentence only since the idea will be expounded later on when the permanent note is written.
2. **Permanent notes** this is based on the fleeting notes that you have taken. In this note, you explain, discuss or comment on your own word your understanding of the topic. In here, we use full sentences and describe everything as much as possible to show our understanding of the topic at hand. You also make sure that you reference your permanent notes with one another that is related to it.
3. **Project notes** are notes for a specific project that you want to accomplish. Once done, this notes will be archived or deleted (based on your preference).
