# Support and Resistance

In Forex trading, support level is the lowest point the price reached before it started going back up again. Resistance level is the highest point the price reached before it started going back down again.

Either buying or selling pressure are present in the support and resistance level since other traders are also watching these levels.

Trend lines are the same as support and resistance but follows the price trends. The price trends either upward or downward. Basically trend lines follow the trend of the price movement.

Every trader interprets the chart differently from one another. Therefore support and resistance level are just psychological levels and can be retained or break through depending on how the market is doing. There is now way to be sure on how the market will move.
