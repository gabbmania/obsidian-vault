# Nobody Starts from Scratch

We are often taught at school of the linear approach to writing, where we think of a topic then start with that topic. Like generating ideas out of that topic and then read sources about that topic to come up with the contents of what we are writing about. This is not a good approach and can sometimes be difficult for a person since we need to cram and read all of the literature for a topic. To have an idea for a topic, we should have read first about that topic. And topic that interests us is what we usually read about. So it would mean that to be able to think of a topic means that we have already an interest in the topic and that we read source about that topic.
