I, of course, do not think everything by myself. It happens mainly within the slip-box

Luhmann’s slip-box is like the old term for “second brain” people used this day. It helped him produce 60 books catering to a lot of topics. And this books, articles and publications are of high quality, a number that is impossible to be achieved by a lot of academics and writers. By utilizing his slip-box method, Luhmann managed to do this without much effort on his part since the ideas has been inside of the slip-box all along. It’s just a matter of organizing the notes for him

Page 28 – 4 hours ago

Luhmann had two slip-boxes: a bibliographical one, which contained the references and brief notes on the content of the literature, and the main one in which he collected and generated his ideas, mainly in response to what he read.

1. Rough notes in the literature or article he read, along of course is the actual reference to the literature. This is more like a literature review or something along that line  
2. Main notes is where he refined the ideas he read. Most likely he referred to his rough notes in order to write the main notes. He comments about what he read and stayed at 1 piece of paper per idea. He restricts his writing to one side of the paper only for easier reading

Whenever he added a note, he checked his slip-box for other relevant notes to make possible connections between them

Connecting notes with one another is what makes his workflow unique and very productive. It gave him a better chance in generating new ideas due to the interconnections of the notes that he has on his slip-box
