# Project Feasibility

1. Clear Problem-Solution Fit: Identified a real-world problem (inefficiencies in car servicing) and proposed a solution that addresses it directly.
2. Scalable Architecture: The tech stack chosen (Python/Django for backend, ReactJS for frontend) is modern, scalable, and widely used, making it easier to resources.
3. Modular Development: The app can be broken down into smaller, manageable modules (e.g., appointment scheduling, inventory management, payment integration), which can be developed incrementally.

Considerations:
- Market Validation: Are service centers and customers willing to adopt this solution? Conduct surveys or interviews with potential users.
- Business Model: How will to monetize the app? Subscription fees for service centers? Transaction fees for payments? Advertising?
- Partnerships: Possibility of partnering with service centers and possibly auto parts suppliers to make this work.
