Elementary:

Support and Resistance Levels:

Support level is the lowest point reached before it started going back up again. Resistance level is the highest point reached before it started going back down again.

Buying/selling pressure are present in the support and resistance level since other traders are also watching that levels.

Trend lines are the same as support and resistance but as the words said, it may be trending up or down. Basically trend lines follow the trend of the price movement.

Support and resistance levels are psychological levels that the traders themselves see. Every trader may interpret a chart differently.

Japanese Candlesticks:

OHLC charting. Open price, highest price, lowest price and close price can be seen in a single candlestick for a specific time frame. Candlesticks can tell how the buyers and sellers interact with one another and might show possible start of a trend or reversal of a trend. However, trading based on candlesticks alone is not advisable. It must be partnered with other tools like support and resistance or trend lines.

There are single candle stick that may show that a reversal is possible where you can potentially enter a trade or there are also dual and triple candlestick patterns.

Fibonacci:

Also another tool for trading. Came from Leonardo Fibonacci. Fibonacci number is a sequence that shows itself in nature and produce the golden ration. 

Fibonacci retracements is a trading strategy that uses the Fibonacci lines in a trading chart. When a price is trending up, there is a chance that it may retrace back down a little and touch some parts of the Fibonacci retracement tool. This levels are where traders can enter on a trade. Since a lot of traders look at these levels, it may be significant. However there are times that the Fibonacci retracement doesn't work at all. 

It is best paired with support and resistance level where if a Fibonacci level coincides with a support or resistance then it can be a strong indication that a retracement is possible in that level. 

It can also be used with a trend line. You can find your entry point if you plot your Fibonacci retracement tool and see that the Fib levels intersect with the trend line. That level can then be a possible entry for a trade that goes with the trend line.
